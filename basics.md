# Basics of micro and nano fab for the DIY lab
* ___This section is under development, and may need re-formmating to better abstract the concepts.___

Here we'll can talk about how to get started in a DIY fasion.

# Obtaining equipment
* ebay
* craigslist
* university surplus
* government auctions
* electronics recyclers

# Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)
[Cost-Effective Systems for Atomic Layer Deposition](http://diyhpl.us/~nmz787/pdf/Cost-Effective_Systems_for_Atomic_Layer_Deposition.pdf)
## Hot-wall reactor
* whole reaction chamber sits in an oven

## Cold-wall reactor
* only the wafer/substrate is heated, usually from below, I guess with something like a hotplate

# Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
