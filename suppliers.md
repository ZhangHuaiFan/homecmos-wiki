# A list of vendors for fabrication supplies
This list was taken from the old wiki.
It might be outdated and is mainly targeted at buyers in the USA.

## Etchants =

  * Local grocery or home improvement store
    Whink brand rust remover contains 2-3% HF.

    HCl for metal etching.

## Photoresist

## Solvents

  * Duda Diesel (http://www.dudadiesel.com/)
    Technical grade acetone and isopropanol. May have lower impurity levels than hardware/paint store grades.
  * Local hardware store
    Acetone, denatured alcohol. May have lower purity.
  * Harmony Cleanroom (http://www.harmonycr.com/)
    99% isopropanol / 1% DI water.
  * Pharmacy or some grocery stores
    Isopropanol (rubbing alcohol). Go for the highest concentration you can get (91% is ideal)

## Wafers

  * MTI (http://www.mtixtl.com/)
  Materials science related supplies including wafers up to 6 inch diameter sold in units of one.
  * University Wafer (http://www.universitywafer.com/)
  Has a wider selection than MTI but minimum orders are high.
  * Singapore Optics Shop (http://optics.sg/main.html)
   This supplier does not have much of a minimum order (Keep orders above or equal to 5 wafers) but prices can be quite high for small wafers. They do have other wafers like Germanium 
and also has quite a lot of other cool stuff. They do ship to countries outside Singapore. Price will include SGD $30 handling fee.
  * Latech Scientific Supply (http://www.latech.com.sg/)
  I am putting them back on here after they have updated their information. They do have a minimum order of 25 pieces for wafers of size 3 inches and above. According to their sales 
representative, wafers smaller than 3 inches can be bought in small quantities. If you want to get a large amount of wafers, I suggest using Latech as their prices are cheaper than 
the ones at Singapore Optics Shop. They also have some lab stuff that experimenters might be interested in.
