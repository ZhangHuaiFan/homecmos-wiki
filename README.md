The goal of this project is to provide information in order to enable interested
people to create their own CMOS and MEMS circuits at home.

The project puts an emphasis on a low-cost process and using methods that are
simple and carry as little risc for things going wrong as possible.

## Project status
The project has been on hiatus for a long time but will commence shortly.
